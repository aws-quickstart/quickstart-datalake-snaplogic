# quickstart-datalake-snaplogic
## Data Lake with SnapLogic on AWS

This Quick Start builds a data lake environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 15 minutes by deploying SnapLogic components and AWS services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift. You can build a new virtual private cloud (VPC) infrastructure thatâ€™s configured for security, scalability, and high availability, or use your existing VPC infrastructure for the data lake.

SnapLogic is a data integration platform that can connect to any source and deliver data in a format that's suitable for analytical solutions. The SnapLogic Groundplex server is the underlying component that processes data from various sources. Groundplex servers are automatically deployed on AWS to enable you to process the data necessary for building analytical solutions.

This Quick Start is intended for users who want to accelerate their big data initiatives. It includes basic integration patterns with Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift by using SnapLogic integration connectors and best practices from Agilisium Consulting.
